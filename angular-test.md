First of all, We wish you best of luck for the test. Please read the entire document carefully before you start writing code.

# Background
The most common use of Angular Frontends is using CRUD APIs to save and view data. We want you to create a Angular application to view a list of records, add records and edit records.

# Assignment
We want you to create a Angular application that has the following areas. You may use any CSS like bootstrap to make the pages look nice.

### Landing Page
- landing page should have list of all persons
- it should have a navigation component which should have option to come back to home page and a create-new navigation (include angular routing)
- 
### Form to create a new Person
- The form should have fields for `first name`, 'last name', `email`
- email field should varify for a valid email id entry before submitting a form 
- first name should start with a capital letter and can not be blank

### List of Persons
- On this page show the Name, Email, Avatar of the person. show them in ascending order by creating a pipe .
- Clicking on the name of any person should open the form to edit the details
- Show the list in a "card" format rather than a simple list. (CardView should be a custom component with input parameters).
- 

Note : You DO NOT need to create any API. The API is already created. The details are available here choose api from list which are suitable for the app - https://reqres.in/


# Assessment Criteria
- Code quality of the Angular Code.
- Code quality of the HTML and CSS if any.
- Look and feel of the form and list pages.

# Deliverable
Create a repository in your github account and commit the code into that repository. Send us the link to the repository.
